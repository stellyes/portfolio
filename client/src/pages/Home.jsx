                            I spent three years at CSU Channel Islands pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science, but had to sadly stop attending before completing my degree due to financial difficulties brought upon by COVID-19.

                        <p>
                            That didn't stop me from finishing what I started. After spending a year interning as a Software Engineer, I wanted to round out my skillset. My university education was one of the best I could have asked for, but my time interning really showed me that I didn't know how to apply the things I was learning in relevant ways. "Being a part of a team working on complex problems while trying to factor in scalability in a cloud environment," was not only a mouthful to explain to my friends and family, but was a lot to take on after only programming in a classroom setting.

                            After saving up a bit, I eventually pursued a Full Stack Developer (MERN) Certification through UC Berkeley Extension.
