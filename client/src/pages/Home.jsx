                            I spent three years at CSU Channel Islands pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science, but had to sadly stop attending before completing my degree due to financial difficulties brought upon by COVID-19.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That didn't stop me from finishing what I started. After spending a year interning as a Software Engineer, I wanted to round out my skillset. My university education was one of the best I could have asked for, but my time interning really showed me that I didn't know how to apply the things I was learning in relevant ways. "Being a part of a team working on complex problems while trying to factor in scalability in a cloud environment," was not only a mouthful to explain to my friends and family, but was a lot to take on after only programming in a classroom setting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After saving up a bit, I eventually pursued a Full Stack Developer (MERN) Certification through UC Berkeley Extension. My job as a student is over for the course, but I look forward to finding a dedicated team of developers to work with and continue my learning as a programmer.

                            I bring a colorful mix of skills to the table, making me a versatile individual who thrives in both the artistic and technical realms. As a multidisciplinary artist, my passion for digital art and graphic design allows me to unleash my creativity, especially when tinkering away on the piano.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When it comes to the tech side of things, I'm your go-to person. I've got a solid background in software engineering, where I dance effortlessly with React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Javascript, Python, and follow the agile beat. My playground is the AWS Cloud, where I build scalable, serverless solutions. Tools like OnRender, AWS Route53, and AWS Amplify? Yep, I've got those in my toolbox to ensure smooth deployment in the cloud.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Testing is my jam too! Whether it's API Testing, Test-Driven Development (TDD), or using Postman and Insomnia, I'm all about making sure everything runs like a well-tuned piano, reliable and flawless.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But hey, I'm not just about the code. I thrive on structured development practices, dabbling in Agile/Scrum Methodology, ORM, OOP, and MVC. My programming languages of choice include Javascript, Python, and C, and I've got the whole HTML5, CSS3, Responsive Design, Bootstrap, PWAs, React.js, and IndexedDB song and dance down pat for modern web development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And databases? I've got those covered too. From MySQL to Sequelize, NoSQL, and MongoDB, I can handle different data management systems like a pro. On the backend, JWT Authentication, Express.js, and Express Middleware are my trusted companions, ensuring robust systems that stand the test of time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a nutshell, I'm not just a tech geek - I'm an artist with a tech twist. Let's bring a splash of creativity and a dose of technical wizardry to your next project!

                            Something not a lot of people know about me is that I'm quite passionate about Agriculture!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Having the privilege to grow up on a farm taught me the importance of nutrition and sustainability. As I grew into my farm boots, I got to thinking about how I could include the community in these benefits as well, leading me to found S.H.I.F.T. Foods at the age of 15. My mission with S.H.I.F.T. (Sustainable, Healthy, Informational, Friendships, and Thrive) was to provide the community with fresh, healthy produce options for those who could otherwise not afford these necessities to live, while educating on the importance and ways to implement agriculture on a small scale so that this model can be replicated across the country.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the two years I was in charge of running the operation at S.H.I.F.T., we managed to donate over 3000lbs. of produce and donate just under $1500 in direct donations through a pie-a-thon fundraiser. The lasting impact that I wanted to create in Whatcom County was to inspire other community members with gardens to actively participate. Change starts with a single seed, and I wanted to be just that. For more information about our operations, check out <a href="https://youtu.be/kwK7ExuKRxM?si=mL-ArssMY3Oa1FGM" className="home-link">this interview piece we did with KING 5</a>, the largest news organization in Washington State, and  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd0IHh_cyBw" className="home-link">this radio interview we did with the Bellingham Herald</a>, the regional newspaper.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These days, I'm located in the Bay Area in a space that doesn't allow me to grow my own produce. In the future, I hope to replicate this model in my current community and continue inspiring people to be the change they want to see!
