                            I spent three years at CSU Channel Islands pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science, but had to sadly stop attending before completing my degree due to financial difficulties brought upon by COVID-19.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That didn't stop me from finishing what I started. After spending a year interning as a Software Engineer, I wanted to round out my skillset. My university education was one of the best I could have asked for, but my time interning really showed me that I didn't know how to apply the things I was learning in relevant ways. "Being a part of a team working on complex problems while trying to factor in scalability in a cloud environment," was not only a mouthful to explain to my friends and family, but was a lot to take on after only programming in a classroom setting. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After saving up a bit, I eventually pursued a Full Stack Developer (MERN) Certification through UC Berkeley Extension. My job as a student is over for the course, but I look forward to finding a dedicated team of developers to work with and continue my learning as a programmer.

                            Something not a lot of people know about me is that I'm quite passionate about Agriculture!   
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Having the privilege to grow up on a farm taught me the importance of nutrition and sustainability. As I grew into my farm boots, I got to thinking about how I could include the community in these benefits as well, leading me to found S.H.I.F.T. Foods at the age of 15. My mission with S.H.I.F.T. (Sustainable, Healthy, Informational, Friendships, and Thrive) was to provide the community with fresh, healthy produce options for those who could otherwise not afford these necessities to live, while educating on the importance and ways to implement agriculture on a small scale so that this model can be replicated across the country. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the two years I was in charge of running the operation at S.H.I.F.T., we managed to donate over 3000lbs. of produce and donate just under $1500 in direct donations through a pie-a-thon fundraiser. The lasting impact that I wanted to create in Whatcom County was to inspire other community members with gardens to actively participate. Change starts with a single seed, and I wanted to be just that. For more information about our operations, check out <a href="https://youtu.be/kwK7ExuKRxM?si=mL-ArssMY3Oa1FGM" className="home-link">this interview piece we did with KING 5</a>, the largest news organization in Washington State, and  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd0IHh_cyBw" className="home-link">this radio interview we did with the Bellingham Herald</a>, the regional newspaper.

                        <p>
                            These days, I'm located in the Bay Area in a space that doesn't allow me to grow my own produce. In the future, I hope to replicate this model in my current community and continue inspiring people to be the change they want to see!
